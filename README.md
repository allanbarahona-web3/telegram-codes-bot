# Telegram Codes Bot

A Telegram bot that assigns each user a **unique referral code** based on their verified phone number.  
It also supports **referral campaigns** and provides **invite links to groups** that are one-time use and expire automatically.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Unique user codes**: each user receives a random, unique code with a country prefix (e.g., `CR-AB12-CD34`).
- **Phone verification**: users must share their phone number via Telegram’s native contact button (no manual typing).
- **Code recovery**: retrieve your code anytime with `/mycode` or the inline button **🔑 Remember my code**.
- **Referral campaigns**:
  - Users share their codes with friends.
  - New users enter the code of the inviter.
  - The bot stores relationships in the database (`referrals` table).
- **Group access control**:
  - Only users who verify their phone and get a code can receive a group invite.
  - Invite links are **single-use** and **expire automatically** after a set number of hours.
